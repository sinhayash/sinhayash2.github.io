    "summary": "I am a PhD student at National University of Singapore. I am working on programmable networks. \n\nMy recent research interests have revolved around networking and machine learning. Recent works include incremental deployment of class based hybridization models for campus networks and real time monitoring of QoS metrics in Software Defined Networks (SDN). I am also working on lung cancer detection and ear biometrics leveraging CNNs and ResNets. \n\nMy work on leveraging WebRTC for P2P content distribution in web browsers and character recognition in natural scene images have been accepted at international conferences. I have been among top 25% at various data science challenges (Kaggle.com) and completed 12 MOOCs on data science and related. \n\nI have played Tabla, drums and octopad and national level competitions.",
